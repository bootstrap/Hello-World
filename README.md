Looking for [twitter bootstrap ] (https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) ?

* Refer to http://pages.github.com/ to set up pages.
* Check project pages!
* Maybe move to the new Tiddlywiki system. Seems to be more efficient.
* Refer to [Github Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown "included code")

# Tables in Github Flavored Markdown?
From https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#wiki-tables
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty

*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
